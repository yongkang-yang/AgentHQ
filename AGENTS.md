# Repository Guidelines

## Project structure

Swift 6 package, macOS 14+. Five targets, layered so that each one depends only
on the ones above it:

- `Sources/AgentHQKit/` — domain model. **No I/O.** If a type here needs a
  socket, a file, or a clock it cannot control, it belongs in another target.
- `Sources/AgentHQTransport/` — `LocalSocketTransport` and `SSHTunnel`. Both
  resolve to a local unix socket path.
- `Sources/AgentHQHerdr/` — the herdr wire protocol. Knows one socket path.
  Must stay ignorant of machines, SSH, and the fleet.
- `Sources/AgentHQFleet/` — `MachineSession` per machine, plus `FleetStore`.
  The only place that knows there is more than one machine.
- `Sources/AgentHQApp/` — SwiftUI menu bar.

Tests live in `Tests/<Target>Tests/`.

## Commands

- `swift build` — compile all targets
- `swift test` — run the Swift Testing suite
- `swift run AgentHQApp` — launch the menu-bar app in development

## Invariants

These are the decisions the architecture exists to protect. Changing one is a
design discussion, not a refactor.

1. **`AgentID` is a faithful echo of herdr's pane id.** It goes back on the
   wire verbatim. Never join a machine id into it — use `AgentRef`.
2. **Machine reachability is not agent state.** An unreachable machine shows as
   unreachable, with its agents marked stale. It never renders as its agents
   having crashed.
3. **Never fabricate state.** Degraded is shown as degraded, with a reason. An
   absent reason line is better than a guessed one.
4. **`AgentHQHerdr` does not import `AgentHQFleet` or `AgentHQTransport`.** The
   package graph enforces this; keep it that way.
5. **One request, one connection.** herdr replies once and closes; reusing a
   connection works exactly once and then fails with EPIPE forever. Verified
   against herdr 0.9.0 / protocol 22. `events.subscribe` is the exception and
   holds its connection open.
6. **Never block an actor on a socket read.** The subscription read has no
   timeout, because silence between events is normal. Running it on an actor
   keeps that actor isolated inside the read forever and deadlocks everything
   that calls it. It runs on a dedicated thread; closing the fd is what stops
   it, since a blocking read cannot be cancelled from outside.
7. **Decode against the live protocol, not an older client.** Protocol 22
   renamed fields that a 17-era client still reads — `revision` for
   `state_change_seq`, `label` for `name`, subscription objects for bare
   strings. A wrong name decodes to zero or empty, not to an error.
8. **No continuous animation inside `MenuBarExtra`.** It causes the panel to
   flicker open and closed. Emphasis is static.

## Style

Four-space indent, standard Swift API naming. Preserve Swift 6 concurrency
guarantees with `Sendable`, actors, and explicit isolation — do not reach for
`@unchecked Sendable` or `nonisolated(unsafe)` to make a warning go away.
No formatter or linter is configured; match the surrounding source.

Comments explain *why*, especially where a decision looks arbitrary but is
paying for a bug someone already hit. Do not comment what the code says.

## Testing

Swift Testing (`import Testing`), behavior-focused `@Suite` / `@Test`
descriptions, `#expect` assertions. Name files `*Tests.swift`. A test name
should read as the claim it defends.

Run `swift test` before submitting.

## Porting from Shepherd

[Shepherd / herdr-manager](https://github.com/sxp4931/herdr-manager) is MIT and
is the reference for the herdr protocol and the design token layer. When you
port a file:

1. Keep the MIT copyright notice at the top of the ported file.
2. Add it to the ported list in `NOTICE`.
3. Do not port its single-machine assumptions along with it — the adapter takes
   a socket path and returns machine-agnostic values.

## Commits and PRs

Concise, descriptive subjects. Explain user-visible impact, protocol or
security implications, and what you validated. Link the Linear issue.

Never commit credentials, socket files, journals, or unredacted agent output.
